Learn best practices, patterns, and processes for designing and implementing data security with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. This course can also help to prepare you for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate exam. Your instructor, Lynn Langit, covers how to use AWS design patterns, tools, and best practices for security, governance, and validation of data used in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and Route 53. She also goes over other AWS tools, such as AWS CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and Inspector; explores encryption concepts; looks at working with security scenarios; and reviews common patterns and practices for implementing disaster recovery processes.

**Topics include**:
- Core AWS security design concepts
- Designing using a data flow diagram
- Using negative use cases
- Working with IAM user and role objects
- Design concepts for encryption
- Design encryption with AWS Key Management Service
- Third-party data security tools
- Designing for disaster recovery services
